## REMAINING — Build Plan (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Content Generation (COMPLETE — 18 of 18 done)
Generate curated content for each section, one at a time, in chat.
Each file requires: read full ACR source text → write JSON → audit every
quiz item word-for-word against ACR → commit.

Content files needed:

Each content file schema:
  id, label, volume, content_version,
  summary_plain, summary_scholarly,

## CONTENT VOICE DIRECTIVE (Locked In)

All curated content must follow these rules without exception:

- Evidence-based, not hypothetical
- Dead Sea Scrolls + Orit Ge'ez as primary witnesses
- No Christianity/rabbinic/Talmud framing
- No use of "LORD", "God", or any substitute for YHWH
- No "apocryphal", "pseudepigraphal", "deuterocanonical" labels
- No academic hedging ("primordial history", "cosmogony", etc.)
- No Samaritan or Septuagint as co-equal witnesses
- Orit Ge'ez is the LIVING primary witness; DSS attest the text
- Masoretic is a later variant only, not a baseline
- Personal names in original Hebrew (Qayin, Noakh, Chanokh, etc.)
- Anglicized forms noted only for learner recognition
- No messianic, no lunar calendar, no New Testament
- Strip "Middle East" label (colonial term invented 1902)
- Deliberately include African, Indigenous, non-Western primary sources
- Treat disappearance from dominant textbooks as a warning sign
- Never soften substitution and erasure — name them directly
- Every quiz item must include source_quote from the actual ACR text
- Every quiz item must be verified word-for-word against data/file_N.json

---

## QUESTION GENERATION RULES (Locked In)

Applies to every quiz item in every `study/content/file_N.json` and to
the Attain reader's in-app generator. All rules must be satisfied —
no exceptions.

### Content Rules
- Generate questions ONLY from the body text of the chapter provided.
- Do NOT use content from: titles, subtitles, headers, introductions,
  table of contents, prefaces, author bios, footnotes, or index pages.
- Every question must be directly answerable from a specific passage
  within the chapter body text.
- Do not infer, assume, or introduce external knowledge not present
  in the provided text.

### Quality Rules
- Questions must test genuine comprehension, not surface scanning.
- Avoid questions answerable by spotting a single keyword.
- At least 60% of questions should require the learner to understand
  meaning, cause/effect, sequence, or character/concept relationships.
- Do not generate trick questions or questions designed to confuse.
- Each correct answer must be unambiguous and directly supported by
  the text.
- Wrong answer choices (distractors) must be plausible but clearly
  incorrect to someone who read the chapter — not random or absurd.

### Format Rules
- Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanation, no preamble.
- Each question object must include:

```
{
  "question": "string",
  "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
  "correct": "A",
  "hint": "string referencing where in the text the answer is found",
  "source_passage": "brief quote or paraphrase from the chapter that supports the answer"
}
```

### Difficulty Balance (per batch of 10)
- 3 recall questions (who, what, where)
- 4 comprehension questions (why, how, what does this mean)
- 3 application/analysis questions (what would happen if, what is the
  relationship between)

### Dyslexia-Friendly Language
- Keep question sentences under 20 words where possible.
- Use plain, direct language.
- Avoid double negatives entirely.
- Avoid jargon unless the jargon itself is the learning target.

### Scope & Cost Constraint
- These rules apply to **chat-time curation only**.
- No AI, no API calls, no paid services may be introduced into the
  deployed app — the app stays 100% free, fully static, GitHub Pages
  only. All question content is either hand-authored in chat under
  the existing plan (for `study/content/`) or generated client-side
  by the Attain parser's algorithmic generator.

### Reconciliation Note
The existing `study/content/file_N.json` files use `source_quote` (not
`source_passage`), integer `correct` index (not letter), and no `hint`
field. Before regenerating any existing file, decide: migrate old
files to this new schema, or keep the old schema and map the new
fields (`source_passage` → `source_quote`, letter `correct` →
numeric index, add `hint` as an optional field). Do not mix schemas
in a single file.

## FREE STACK (Locked In)

Every current and future feature must use ONLY these — no paid APIs,
no subscription services, no keys.

- **Web Speech API** (built-in browser) — all TTS and voice recognition
- **MediaRecorder API** (built-in browser) — audio capture for Dictation
  Challenge and any record-and-compare modes
- **HTML5 drag-and-drop** — native browser DnD for simple reorder/match
- **SortableJS** (MIT licensed, free) — richer drag interactions; vendor
  into `study/lib/` (no CDN dependency)
- **vis.js** or **Cytoscape.js** (MIT/Apache, free) — Mind Map Builder,
  Concept Web, Chapter Timeline; vendor into `study/lib/`
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting (free tier, static only)
- **localStorage / IndexedDB / Cache Storage / cookies** — all persistence
- **JSON files** — all content

Forbidden even if free-tier exists:
- OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / any hosted LLM API
- Firebase, Supabase, any hosted DB
- Google Analytics, Mixpanel, any tracker
- Paid fonts (use Google Fonts only)
- Any service that could introduce a future paywall

Why vendor instead of CDN: CDNs can go down, rate-limit, or start
charging. Vendoring a 30-50KB library into `study/lib/` is free, offline,
and permanent.

## PENDING INSTRUCTIONS BACKLOG (Locked In)

The following were handed down in session and must not be lost. Build
order is flexible; none should silently disappear.

### #3 — Question Validation
Eleven per-question checks + one batch-level difficulty-balance check.
Target file: `study/validate-questions.js` (standalone, NOT shipped to
the app, run in chat during curation).

Checks required:
1. `checkRequiredFields` — question, options, correct, hint,
   source_passage all present and non-empty
2. `checkQuestionLength` — question sentence ≤ 20 words where possible
3. `checkNoDoubleNegative` — reject double negatives outright
4. `checkAnswerIsUnambiguous` — only one option can be the correct answer
5. `checkDistractorsNotAbsurd` — distractors must be plausible wrong
   answers, not nonsense
6. `checkAnswerInOptions` — the `correct` value must match one of the
   `options`
7. `checkSourcePassageExists` — `source_passage` text must appear in
   the provided `bodyText`
8. `checkNotFromFrontMatter` — question must not reference titles,
   TOC, prefaces, author bios, footnotes, or index
9. `checkNoJargonDump` — avoid jargon unless jargon IS the learning
   target
10. `checkDistractorsArePlausible` — distractors belong to the same
    category/domain as the answer
11. `checkAnswerNotKeywordOnly` — answer can't be spotted by scanning
    a single keyword without comprehension

Batch-level:
- `checkDifficultyBalance` — per batch of 10: 3 recall / 4 comprehension
  / 3 application-analysis (20–40% / 30–50% / 20–40% ratios)

Wrappers: `validateQuestion(q, bodyText)` returns
`{valid, reasons[]}`. `validateBatch(questions, bodyText)` filters to
passing questions and warns on failures.

### #4 — Remix Round
Track every question a user misses during any game mode in the
current session. At round end, resurface those questions in a
**different** game format — e.g. missed a Fill-in-Blank → reappears
as Multiple Choice → then as Flashcard. Prevents the user from
failing the exact same experience twice.

Storage: localStorage key `acr_study_remix_queue` with schema
`[{chapterId, questionRef, missedInMode, missedAt}]`. Cleared when
the remixed version is answered correctly, or at session end if
the user quits.

UI: appears as a new card at the end of every round titled
"Remix Round" — same visual weight as other activity cards.

### #5 — Hint Ladder
Three progressive hint levels on any question:
1. **Letter hint** — reveal starting letter + word length (e.g.
   "Starts with D, 7 letters")
2. **Passage hint** — pull the source passage from the chapter
3. **Blanked reveal** — show the answer with middle letters blanked
   (e.g. `D _ _ _ _ _ M`)

Full answer only appears after all three hints exhausted AND the
user submits a final guess.

UI: a single `<button class="hint-btn">` component that updates its
own label each stage: "💡 Hint" → "📖 Show passage" → "🔡 Reveal pattern"
→ (disabled after 3). Consumed hints reduce XP reward for that
question (e.g. 10 XP → 7 → 4 → 1).

### #6 — Game Modes Backlog
Sixteen suggested modes. Some overlap with existing cards — those
are marked `equiv`. Build order is not fixed; pick one at a time.

| Mode | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Fill the Gap | `equiv` | Existing Fill in the Blank |
| Streak Rewards | `equiv` | Existing XP + daily streak |
| Echo Read | `equiv` | Existing Listen & Learn + tap-any-word |
| Chapter Timeline | backlog | Already Priority 7 |
| Mind Map Builder | backlog | Already Priority 7 |
| Concept Web | backlog | Already Priority 7 |
| Remix Round | backlog | See #4 above |
| Syllable Tap | new | Tap syllable boundaries in chapter words — dyslexia aid |
| Rhyme Chain | new | Chain rhyming words drawn from the chapter |
| Word Morph | new | Change one letter at a time between two chapter words |
| Story Sequence | new | Reorder chapter events in correct order |
| True or False with Why | new | T/F statement + tap the passage that proves it |
| Who Said It | done | Scans source_quotes (Study) / chapter paragraphs (Attain) for dialogue attribution patterns; MC-style picks speaker from 4 options; Hint Ladder + Remix integration |
| Cause and Effect Match | new | Pair cause paragraph to effect paragraph |
| Audio Fill the Gap | done | TTS auto-plays prompt with "blank" spoken at the missing word; reuses FB engine + Hint Ladder; green banner distinguishes mode |
| Dictation Challenge | new | Hear a verse, type it back; compare |
